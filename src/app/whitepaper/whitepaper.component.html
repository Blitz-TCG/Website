    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The basic premise of competitive Trading Card Games (TCGs) has remained unchanged since the early 90s when <i>Magic:
      The Gathering</i> stormed onto the scene paving the way for the many physical and digital card game variants to follow
      [1]. Competitive TCGs revolve around players using preplanned decks from which cards are typically drawn at random
      throughout a match. Players then use those cards to outplay enemy cards in a turn-by-turn environment. In the most
      popular of TCGs, there is often a resource payment associated with playing certain cards; a few examples:
    <i>Hearthstone&rsquo;s</i> mana [2] (i.e., primary resource), <i>Pok&eacute;mon&rsquo;s energy</i> [3] (i.e., secondary cards), and classical
    <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!&rsquo;s</i> monsters [4] (i.e., primary cards).</p>
    <p>Blitz TCG&reg; breaks free from these traditional factors through several key traits: allowing players access to their
      entire deck, implementing a chess-like timebank system, General abilities, and adding NPC alternatives to the gameboard.
       Our goal is to create a digital TCG that mixes iconic aspects from several game genres together to create a refreshing
        alternative to standard TCG gameplay. Balancing Blitz&rsquo;s two primary resources, Gold and XP (experience), while
        choosing a General that compliments a player&rsquo;s deck, will ensure that there are always new strategies to explore.
         Learn about the world of Blitz, game design, decision making, mock-ups, rules, tokenomics, and more in the
         following sections.</p>
    <h2 id="Theory">Theory</h2>
    <p>Blitz draws inspiration from several sources, including <i>Warhammer</i>, <i>Gods Unchained</i>, <i>Hearthstone</i>, <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, <i>DOTA</i>,
      <i>BattleForge</i>, and the <i>Blitz</i> format of chess. <i>Gods Unchained</i> is an excellent example of what is possible using blockchain
        technology to facilitate digital ownership of cards and exchanges between players [5]. However, there are opportunities
         for innovation in both standard gameplay mechanics and digital ownership. Development, design, and general decisions
         about the game and tokenomics will always lean toward a &ldquo;Gameplay First&rdquo; mantra: by creating fun, engaging, and low
         barrier-to-entry gameplay, other aspects of the game will naturally prosper. This section will focus on the thought
          processes associated with the specifics found in the <a href="/whitepaper#Mechanics">Mechanics</a> and <a href="/whitepaper#TokenomicsTheory">Tokenomics</a>
        sections.</p>
    <h3 id="MechanicsTheory">Mechanics Theory</h3>
    <p>For many competitive players, one virtue of gaming remains desired: consistency. In TCGs, this is the ability for
      a player to predict how their strategy will affect the state of a match, given the chance of drawing a specific card
       within a given number of turns. Some might compare consistency to fairness, specifically the minimizing of the chance
        a player will win or lose based on luck. Thus, one of the most inconsistent factors in TCGs is the drawing of cards
         used in each match. For some, this is a staple of what makes a TCG unique. For others, it is a reason to avoid the
          game genre. Blitz will remove this factor from matches entirely, allowing players to access their entire decks
          from the start of a match. The only limiting factors in playing cards will be the amount of Gold a player has
          acquired and, in some cases, the level of their General. Blitz&rsquo;s deck concept is most like an item store available
           in popular MOBAs.</p>
    <p>Competitive TCGs like <i>Hearthstone</i> and <i>Gwent</i> have 7-minute and 12-minute average game lengths, respectively [7, 8].
      Blitz will be a turn-based game and rely on a timebank system with the similar parameters as the <i>Blitz</i> format of
      fast chess [6]. Players will start a match with 3 minutes of banked time. After each player&rsquo;s turn, they will be
       awarded 2 additional seconds of banked time (may change based on playtesting outcomes). Thus, assuming turns
       take at most 20 seconds, the maximum amount of time a Blitz game can last is approximately 15 minutes. A timebank
        system will help ensure gameplay remains active and engaging. Matches will only end in a draw if neither General
         has been damaged.</p>
    <p>Gold is Blitz&rsquo;s first approach to a unique TCG resource system. Players will start a match with the same amount of
      Gold. At the start of a match, players will bid a certain amount of Gold to determine which player moves first. Gold
       will be obtained passively throughout a match, by defeating enemy cards, and by defeating NPCs. Hence, players will
        need to weigh the benefit of spending versus saving to acquire stronger cards. For example, players might purchase
        cards with the intent to defeat NPCs to obtain more Gold than otherwise could have been gained by just saving. Given
         that a player&rsquo;s cards must be active on the board before they are able to attack NPCs and the limitation that,
          unless specified otherwise, a single card can only attack once per turn, it may not always be advantageous to
          spend a turn attacking NPCs when there are enemy cards to consider.
    </p>
    <p>Level is Blitz&rsquo;s second approach to resources. Generals will start a match at Level 1. Level can be increased by
      gaining XP through battling enemy cards, NPCs, or card abilities. Higher level Generals can use more of their
      abilities. In addition, some of the most powerful cards will require a certain General, minimum Level, and some
       cost of Gold to be able to play. By Generals directly influencing the game through unique abilities, it will
       encourage players to strategize their gameplay to some degree around what their General brings to each match.
        The player who defeats an opposing player&rsquo;s General or whose General has the highest amount of Health at the end
         of the match will be declared the winner.</p>
    <p>Gold and Level will maintain a strong relationship over the course of individual matches and, moreover, game design
       and balancing. Players will develop varying strategies surrounding both resources e.g., rushing one resource over
        another with the intent to overwhelm in the early game versus late game.</p>
    <h3 id="TokenomicsTheory">Tokenomics Theory</h3>
    <p>Ergo, Cardano, and Nervos are slated to be the backbone of the smart contracts and tokens necessary to facilitate
      the player-to-player exchange ecosystem. Ergo was selected due to it being an up-and-comer in the crypto space, it
       being backed by a strong and active development team, and the low fees inherent to its Layer 1 (L1) platform.
       There is less competition and more room to grow on a blockchain like Ergo relative to a platform like Ethereum.
        The Ergo community is known to be one of the best in crypto, providing an excellent platform for engagement
         and feedback. Cardano brings a significant userbase and maintains similar ethics and great community. Nervos
          allows for a novel approach to cross-chain integration that will ideally allow Blitz to become the first
          true interoperable blockchain game. Blitz will be the first of its kind to utilize three separate blockchains
           that have varying consensus algorithms.</p>
    <p>The <i>Gods Unchained</i> TCG on the Ethereum network is a notable example of implementing digital ownership for players.
      Much of the theory surrounding the tokenomics of Blitz was derived from understanding the successes and pitfalls
      of <i>Gods Unchained</i> [5]. In Blitz, there will be improvements made to the <i>Gods Unchained</i> card token
      ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Initially, players will be able acquire digital packs of cards. These packs will have their own associated token for
       each production run, akin to how cards are printed for physical TCGs. Purely for example, the &ldquo;Initial 1st Edition Set&rdquo;
        will have packs minted, say 100,000 minted packs. Those packs will be acquired by players for a set amount of
        currency, say 5 ERG. There will never be additional packs minted of the “Initial 1st Edition Set” after they are
         sold, but there will be &ldquo;Unlimited Edition&rdquo; runs produced to ensure players can gain access to limited high
         value cards &ndash; very similar to <i>Pok&eacute;mon&rsquo;s</i> and <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!&rsquo;s</i> print runs.</p>
    <p>Acquired packs will be exchangeable via a smart contract for five cards. Card generation will follow a pseudorandom
       methodology based on the type of pack purchased. A player will be able to connect an Ergo, Cardano, or Nervos Wallet
        that maintains packs and open (i.e., exchange) those packs for cards. Based on our 100,000-pack example above
        for the Initial 1st Edition Set, this means that there will only ever be 500,000 cards minted for this imaginary
         set. Like in many modern physical TCGs, players might choose to leave packs unopened as demand for unopened
          packs could exceed individual cards depending on the cost of individual cards. In the spirit of proper
          free-to-play games, there will be a standard set of competitive non-blockchain cards that all players can use.</p>
    <p>Rarity is a topic of debate and is one of the most diverse aspects when comparing TCGs, both physical and digital.
      Blitz will maintain a more traditional approach to rarity. Card rarity will follow rarity indicators more like
      <i>Pokémon</i> and <i>Yu-Gi-Oh!</i> compared to  <i>Gods Unchained</i>; each of the 4 card rarities will have an associated rarity
      symbol and card frame. Pull rates of rare cards will be dependent on the types of packs purchased
      (i.e., a common pack will cost less but be less likely to provide players with rare cards).</p>
    <p>Although not necessary for initial release, a future requirement to allow a better player driven economy to flourish
      on the Ergo blockchain is a Layer 2 (L2) solution like the Immutable X platform on Ethereum. L2 solutions cut down
      on fees associated with exchanging tokens and currency, and increases transaction speed (i.e., the opening of packs).
       Ergo already has the capability to facilitate a L1 player exchange system, but it will carry across the current
       transaction fee and speed of the Ergo blockchain. At minimum, players will be able to view tokens and exchange
       tokens (i.e., MetaMask-like signature confirmation when confirming a transaction, review of transactions able
        to be acted on, and routing of tokens/funds based on what was exchanged). Linking Ergo, Cardano, and
        Nervos Wallets to user accounts will be necessary to utilize cards in-game.</p>
    <p>After the technical blockchain aspects of packs and cards are solidified, blockchain-based General variants and
      gameboard variants will be able to be acquired and traded (completely cosmetic in utility). The theory for these
      items does not differ much from what was stated above; additional ways to add ownership to a player&rsquo;s experience
       will help ensure longevity and interaction with the game.</p>
    <p>As of July 2023, a novel approach and inclusion for a BLTZ token was introduced. Starting on Ergo, the BLTZ token
       will be generated based on a new internally named &ldquo;Proof of Burn&rsquo; algorithm. In short, the total available supply
        of BLTZ tokens at launch will be 0, much like Bitcoin. BLTZ tokens will only be generated as cards are burned.
         For example, Margo may be valued at 100 BLTZ tokens at launch so players could burn Margo to receive 100 BLTZ
         tokens, removing the Margo that is burned from the blockchain entirely. This allows players to have an alternative
          to selling cards on an open exchange. In addition, via Ergo smart contracts, a halving mechanism will be
          implemented that activates after a certain number of cards are burned. Purely for example, after 10,000
          total cards are burned, the Margo card will be worth 50 BLTZ instead of 100 BLTZ. This creates a unique
           and dynamic economy where the value of BLTZ tokens will be purely based on the amount of cards burnt,
            whereas the value of cards will very likely be based on the availability of the cards themselves.
            As this is a new and novel approach to tokenomics, it is a fact that there is an inherent risk to
            implementing it. However, we feel strongly that a fair launch and open economy is the only way to
            promote an organic and transparent ecosystem for collectors and players.</p>
    <h2 id="Lore">Lore</h2>
    <p>Longevity in games is often dictated by replayability and investment into its characters or story. Blitz&rsquo;s
      central theme will be that surrounding a time and society millenniums ahead of today. In Blitz, a universal
       conflict is inevitable as resources have grown too thin for the many races that inhabit its worlds.
       To circumvent an all-out war and destruction of races, all intelligent lifeforms abide by the Blitz Treaty.
        The Blitz Treaty states that every century each race will pit their best leaders, tacticians, or warriors
         (i.e., Generals) against one another in a battle of wits. By winning matches of Blitz, Generals secure
         resources for their race under the Blitz Treaty, thus prolonging their races longevity.</p>
    <p>As the game progresses, specifics regarding races, their interests, their Generals, the universe, and more
      will be expanded upon. Our official website will maintain all Lore documentation. For example:</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-3"> <img src="/assets/page5.jpg" alt=""> </div>
        <div class="col-9"> <b>Margo, Queen of the Masquerades</b>
            <p>Little is known about the Masquerade clan. What is known paints images of violence and countless tragedies
               spanning the cosmos. Margo, the current leader of the Masquerades, is told to be a ruthless fighter,
                unforgiving and lacking any notion for mercy. The mask she dons is rumored to be carved and painted
                 from the skull of the Masquerades previous leader, Margo&rsquo;s father. </p>

    <h3 id="Rules">Rules</h3>
    <p>Details of the ruleset below are subject to change based on playtesting. The <a
            href="/whitepaper#Roadmap">Roadmap
            and Future Vision</a> section explores additional ideas that could alter the ruleset described below e.g.,
        2v2 matches.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Each player will each start with the same amount of Gold.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Each player will start with their selected General at Level 1. Generals will have a max Level of 10.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Players will start a match with 3 minutes of banked time. After each player&rsquo;s turn, they will be
                awarded 2 additional seconds of banked time. If a player took less than 2 seconds to move, they will not
                gain any time back. A player that moves within 2.0 to 3.9 seconds will only receive 1.0-1.9 seconds of
                time back, respectively. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Players will receive gold passively at the ends of their turns, ramping up depending on how long the
                match has lasted.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Each player is allowed up to a certain number of total cards in their decks (number to be determined
                based on future balancing).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Each player will only be allowed up to a certain number of cards based on Level requirement e.g., up to
                10 Level 1 cards, up to five Level 2-5 cards, and so forth (actual numbers to be determined based on
                future balancing).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Field Limits will exist for some cards meaning that only a limited number of said cards can be on a
                friendly field at the same time. This is to prevent game breaking stackable buffs or debuffs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Each player will have a max of 20 seconds per turn to set and use cards or abilities. Turns will
                automatically end at the 20 second limit. There will be incentives for moving faster based on time
                thresholds. For example, if a player moves in less than 5 seconds, they will receive some ## of Gold at
                the end of their turn. Players that end their turns between 5-10 seconds will receive some lesser amount
                of Gold, and so forth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Players can purchase cards during their opponent&rsquo;s turn but can only set and use cards during their
                own turn. Some General abilities will be useable during an opponent&rsquo;s turn.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Some race-locked cards will only be playable when using a General of the same race.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>After a global countdown for the match to begin, there will be a blind auction that lasts up to 30
                seconds or until each player bids to determine which player moves first. For example, if each player
                starts with 500 Gold and Player 1 bids 300 and Player 2 bids 400, Player 2 will get to move first.
                Player 2 loses 400 Gold in exchange for moving first, whereas Player 1 loses no Gold. If players do not
                bid or there is a tie, then a player will be chosen at random.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>After the blind auction ends, the match will officially start after 5 seconds. Players can purchase cards
                with their remaining blind auction Gold in this timeframe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cards set, unless specified otherwise, must wait 1 turn before attacking or moving.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Players can only set up to 12 cards on the field at a time and hold up to 8 in their hand (numbers
                expected to change based on play testing). Other than available field space and resources, there is no
                limit to the number of cards a player can set per turn.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cards will remain on the field until defeated (i.e., health reaches zero).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If a player&rsquo;s friendly Wall is intact, any cards placed on the friendly Backline are hidden from
                opposing attackers and unattackable unless specified otherwise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If a player&rsquo;s friendly Wall is intact, any cards placed on the friendly Backline will be unable to
                attack any cards or NPCs unless specified otherwise.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Frontline cards will be able to attack the opposing players cards, NPCs, and Wall. Once an enemy Wall is
                destroyed, attacking players can attack any opposing Cards on the field and enemy General. After a
                friendly Wall is destroyed, Backline cards will be able to attack opposing cards, NPCs, and enemy
                General (assuming the enemy Wall is also destroyed).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Players can move a card from the Backline to Frontline or vice versa. Moving a card from one field area
                to another will cost that card its action for the turn unless specified otherwise. Once a player&rsquo;s
                friendly Wall is destroyed, there is no longer any concept of Backline or Frontline, and their friendly
                field is treated as a singular entity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Walls will have some set amount of health (not yet defined). Upon the health of a Wall reaching zero, it
                is destroyed and cannot be rebuilt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cards will deal damage based on their current Attack.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cards and NPCs that are attacked (i.e., defending cards), unless specified otherwise, will damage the
                attacker for the Attack of the defending card.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Each player will have a friendly NPC that spawns at the start of the match and at the end of every sixth
                turn. NPCs that meet one another will attack each other at the end of each player&rsquo;s turn. If there
                is no opposing NPC, the friendly NPC will continue to move. If an NPC makes it into the enemy
                player&rsquo;s NPC spawner, the friendly player will receive a substantial number of resources. For
                example, on turn 1 both NPCs will be as is shown below and proceed toward the center of the gameboard by
                turn 3. It takes 6 turns for an uninhibited NPC to reach an enemy spawner. Further, when an enemy NPC is
                destroyed, the friendly player will gain resources.</p> <img class="mb-4" src="/assets/page9.png"

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When the health of a Card, NPC, Wall, or General reaches zero it is destroyed, and the opposing player
                will get some amount of Gold and XP in return (defeating a General will end the match).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>When the health of the friendly or opposing General reaches zero the match is over, and the player of the
                conquering General is victorious.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>At the point a player&rsquo;s timebank reaches zero, the opposing player will get one additional turn,
                and then the player whose General has the highest percentage of health remaining is victorious. If no
                Generals have been damaged or Generals have the same remaining health, then the match is counted as a
                draw.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Future: Some cards will have tiers meaning that they will have evolved or upgraded forms available during
                a match. Although the previous form of a card will not be required to play the upgraded form, the
                previous form will be able to be exchanged for the upgraded form for the player to receive some amount
                of Gold in return.</p>

    <h2 id="TokenomicsandRarity">Tokenomics and Rarity</h2>
    <h3 id="PacksandCards">Packs and Cards</h3>
    <p>There are two factors proven time and time again that must remain consistent for a competitive game to flourish
        and remain relevant: removing or minimizing any pay-to-win aspects and ensuring gameplay remains fresh. To some
        degree, these two concepts are at odds with the ideas of purchasing cards, cryptocurrency, tokens, and the like.
        For example, when tokens are minted, they are often unable to be changed and thus the balancing of card
        abilities becomes more difficult. Moreover, as sets are produced, there will be a limited number of packs able
        to be purchased and thus prices of cards within those packs could increase making the barrier of entry too high
        for some players.
    </p>
    <p>To avoid these pitfalls, Blitz will implement tokenomics and gameplay choices that ensure players are able to
        remain engaged despite typical token complications.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>The first minting run of every set will be the &ldquo;1st Edition&rdquo; (1ED) version of the set. The
                1ED version of sets will have a very limited production and provide players with unique cosmetic
                experiences in-game. For example, certain cards within the 1ED set will have different skins, appear
                differently on the gameboard, or even have different sound effects when compared to the &ldquo;Unlimited
                Edition&rdquo; (UED) of the same card (specifics TBD). Players that own 1ED cards will also be awarded
                more Blitz TCG tokens compared to players who use UED cards (Blitz TCG token specifics defined further
                below). The 1ED sale period ends when all 1ED packs have been sold or after a certain length of time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Upon the start of a competitive season, an &ldquo;Unlimited Edition&rdquo; (UED) run will occur. The UED
                run will allow players to acquire all cards necessary for competitive play, albeit with less exclusivity
                and thus less collectible value. UED packs will be purchasable throughout the entirety of the
                competitive season in which they were introduced. After the current competitive season ends and new sets
                are introduced, pack token generation of the previous set will be terminated. Therefore, although UED
                packs have no upper limit during a competitive season, the supply of UED cards will hit a cap once the
                season ends. Since cards can be balanced in Blitz, cards from previous seasons will still be sought
                after in subsequent seasons, cementing their value for both the player and collector.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Much like <i>Hearthstone&rsquo;s</i> approach to competitive gameplay balancing, sets will be rotated out of
                competitive play on some seasonal basis. All cards will still be useable in certain noncompetitive game
                modes, but only approved cards from previous sets and current in-season sets will be useable in
                competitive play.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Players will be able to burn cards in exchange for BLTZ tokens (i.e., exchange cards directly to a
               standing smart contract). For example, if a player opens 20 packs (100 cards) and only wants to
               keep 10 of them, they can choose to sell the remaining 90 cards on the open market, or they can
                choose to exchange those cards for a set amount of BLTZ tokens based on card rarity. Those
                acquired BLTZ tokens can then be used to purchase additional packs, sold on an exchange, or
                perhaps at some point used to vote on game direction and balance.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cards in Blitz will be more like tokens versus typical NFTs. There will not be any mint numbers, e.g., 1
                Margo = 1 Margo, and no Margo is rarer than another Margo in each set. The token images will have a
                character image, card frame, some character descriptions, and so forth, but the card values like Health
                and Attack will not be present. This will allow us to freely balance our cards in order to put gameplay
                first. Learn more about this different approach to card tokenomics by watching

    <p>The following illustrations and numerical values represent the current plan and estimations for initial pack sale
        volumes and pack types. As Blitz gets closer to the minting of the first set, these values are expected to
        change. See <a href="/whitepaper#Appendix">Appendix
            [A]</a> for additional calculation detail surrounding how these values were derived.</p>

    <p>Assuming packs are purchased in the percentage distribution described by Image 5, the average cost of a Blitz
        card will be 1.18 USD. This is in line with what a consumer finds reasonable to pay based on the research
        conducted into prior TCG card sales, specifically those of Gods Unchained&rsquo;s initial set (<a
            href="/whitepaper#Appendix">Appendix
            [A]</a>).</p>
    <p>Cards in Blitz will maintain 1 of 4 rarity indicators (CURL):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Common</b> &ndash; the most basic and standard cards</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Uncommon</b> &ndash; cards that inherently have more depth, restrictions, or specific uses</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Rare</b> &ndash; cards that are likely General-specific and improve General-based strategies</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Legendary</b> &ndash; cards likely key for end-game strategy or that bring overwhelming change</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Cards in Blitz will also maintain 1 of 4 Level Brackets:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p><b>Starter</b> &ndash; level 1 cards.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Low</b> &ndash; level 2-4 cards.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Mid</b> &ndash; level 5-7 cards</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Upper</b> &ndash; level 8-10 cards</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Thus, in total, there are 16 potential rarities in Blitz. The rarest card will be Legendary-Upper (LU), while the
        lowest will be Common-Starter (CS). If edition is considered, then there are 32 potential rarities (16 1ED and
        16 UED)</p>
    <p>Tetlon&rsquo;s Medium article does an excellent job describing and analyzing what a user could expect rarity-wise
        from purchasing certain pack types from GU&rsquo;s initial pack sale. Much of the detail here uses
        Tetlon&rsquo;s analysis as a basis, albeit Blitz&rsquo;s rarity will be simpler in that there are no card
        &ldquo;shines&rdquo; [9]. In Blitz, the chances of receiving certain rarity cards will depend on the rarity of
        the pack purchased; higher rarity packs will have higher chances of containing higher rarity cards. Again, these
        values are expected to change as the game matures. There will be 3 types of packs in Blitz; in ascending order
        of rarity: Common, Uncommon, and Rare.</p>

    <p>This section is reserved for future information about the BLTZ token outside of what has already been described
      in previous sections. As the Ergo smart contracts necessary to facilitate the fair start &ldquo;Proof of Burn&rdquo;

    <h2 id="Roadmap">Roadmap and Future Vision</h2>
    <p>The Blitz TCG 2023 roadmap is provided in a visual format below. Dates are rough estimates based on how long
        similar well-thought projects in this space typically take.</p>
    <img class="mb-4" src="/assets/page14.png" alt="">
    <p class="image-description">Image 6: Blitz TCG 2023 Roadmap.</p>
    <p>There are additional features that could be added into the game if time and resources allow. Examples can be
        found below.</p>
    <ol>
        <li class="line-style">
            <p><b>Gameboards and Skins:</b> : gameboards, skins, and other cosmetic collectables add value to a player&rsquo;s
               experience &ndash; blockchain tokens or otherwise. The more there is to achieve, the more likely players will
                stick around. *Gameboards are in scope as of February 2023.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Campaign:</b> computer AI are often a good player teaching and practice tool, and it would be fun to have
              an in-game story mode where, upon completion, additional Generals or non-token cards could be unlocked.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>2v2 Game Mode:</b> due to the nature of Blitz, specifically its more active gameplay style, expanding the
                amount of field spaces in a thoughtful manner and allowing two players to simultaneously play together
                would add a level of complexity and engagement unprecedented in the current digital TCG landscape.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><b>Additional Content:</b> broadly speaking, given enough time and resources, additional cards, additional Lore,
                Generals, game modes, collectibles, ladders, and more could be introduced.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="Team">Team</h2>
    <p>Blitz TCG will remain a small, talented, and decentralized team for the foreseeable future.</p>
