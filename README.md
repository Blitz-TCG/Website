# Blitz TCG Website
The Blitz TCG速 website is designed to complement the game's innovative features by providing an engaging online presence. It showcases the game's rich lore, intricate mechanics, and serves as a hub for community interaction and news updates.

# Getting Started
To start contributing to the Blitz TCG速 website, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Node.js and Angular CLI installed to run the project.
3. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install` in the project directory.

# Before you start the development server:
- You must obtain your own Firebase configuration files (`firebase.json`, `firestore.rules`, etc.), as these have been removed from the repository for security reasons.
- You will also need to set up local environment variables for development, which are not tracked in this repository. Reach out to us for help in creating your `.env` configurations.
- There are likely a few other firebase-specific items you will not have access to, so be aware that it will take some troubleshooting to stand up.
- To run the development server, execute `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

# Security Measures
In the spirit of open source, we have taken steps to ensure that no sensitive information is present within the repository. The following types of files have been excluded and purged from the history for security reasons:
- Firebase configuration and rules files
- Local `.env` files containing sensitive environment variables
- Production environment files within `src/environments`
- Service files that may contain API keys or sensitive logic
- Server-side code that may contain sensitive information

Please ensure that you maintain this security stance by not committing sensitive configurations to your public repositories.
